# Rush_Spotify

Hello ! 

This is a school project made with a group of four members (including myself). The goal was to create a library where you can listen and discover some tracks, styles, artists etc. All the musics are no copyrighted.

We used PHP/SQL, Lumen & React for all of this (was the goal of this project). It was the first time with React & Lumen by the way.

Feel free to discover our project.
